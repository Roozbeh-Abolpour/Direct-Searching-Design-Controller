# Direct-Searching-Design-Controller
This repository contains codes of our articles in the topic of designing controller for some of control systems.

The uploaded codes deal with stabilization problems in LTI, LPV,and delay systems. These codes are related to the following papers

For the LTI systesm:
R. Abolpour, M. Dehghani, and H.A. Talebi, Output feedback controller for polytopic systems exploiting the direct searching of the design space, International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control, 2019.

For delay systems:
R. Abolpour,M. Dehghani, and H.A. Talebi, A non-conservative state feedback control methodology for linear systems with state delay, International Journal of Systems Science, 2021.

For LPV systems:
R. Abolpour, M. Dehghani, M.S. Sadabadi, Designing controller parameters of an LPV system via design space exploration, European Journal of Control, 2021.
